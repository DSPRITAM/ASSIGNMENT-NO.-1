    "### 1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "# Inheritance is fundamental concept,\n",
    "    # with the help of that we can use methods and behaviour of one class in the other class.\n",
    "# it enables creation of hierarchy to classes where,\n",
    "    # subclasses inherit the characteristics of their parent classes.\n",
    "# The class from which other class inherit is called base class or parent class, \n",
    "    # and the other class is called child class or derived class or sub class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# For following reason inheritance is used in OOPs.\n",
    "# 1. code reusability:\n",
    "    # Inheritance promotes code reusability, we just need to specify characteristics in the base class\n",
    "        # and we can use it multiple times in the sub classe.\n",
    "        \n",
    "# 2. Modularity and Organisation:\n",
    "    # it becomes easy to understand the code and read the code when we use inheritance.\n",
    "    # it avoid repeatablity, which enables easy to organise.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3. Polymorphism:\n",
    "    # Inheritance allows object of different classes to be treated as a one object.\n",
    "    # it becomes easy to use the atributes and methods in different classes.\n",
